    "### Overview of Deductive Program Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **program verifier** takes two inputs:\n",
    "  1. The **source code** of your program.\n",
    "  2. A **specification** of what the program is supposed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifications can range from:\n",
    "  - Simple properties (e.g., no arithmetic/buffer overflows).\n",
    "  - Rich behavioral specifications (e.g., the program sorts an array).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The verifier analyzes the program and produces a **verification condition** (VC), a first-order logic formula (typically SMT).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the VC is **valid**, we know the program satisfies its specification.\n",
    "  - Validity is checked by a **theorem prover** (e.g., an SMT solver).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If not valid, it could mean:\n",
    "  - The program has a **bug**.\n",
    "  - The spec is incorrect.\n",
    "  - The verifier had **limitations**.\n",

    "### Hoare Logic: The Foundation of Program Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hoare Logic is the logical system most program verifiers are based on.\n",
    "- Invented by **Tony Hoare**, also the inventor of quicksort.\n",
    "- Sometimes called **Floyd-Hoare Logic** due to similar work by **Robert Floyd**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The IMP Language\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a simple imperative language called **IMP** to illustrate Hoare Logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expressions**: integers, variables, arithmetic ops (`+`, `*`)\n",
    "- **Boolean Conditions**: `true`, `false`, comparisons (`=`, `<=`, etc.)\n",
    "- **Statements**:\n",
    "  - `x := e` (assignment)\n",
    "  - `s1; s2` (sequencing)\n",
    "  - `if c then s1 else s2` (conditional)\n",
    "  - `while c do s` (loop)\n",

    "### Hoare Triples\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Hoare triple** has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "    { P } S { Q }\n",
    "\n",
    "- `P` is the **precondition** (must hold before execution)\n",
    "- `Q` is the **postcondition** (must hold if the program terminates)\n",
    "- `S` is a statement from IMP\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning**:  \n",
    "If you execute `S` in a state satisfying `P`, and the execution **terminates**, then `Q` must hold afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hoare triples describe **partial correctness**:\n",
    "  - They say nothing about whether `S` terminates.\n",
    "  - Only that if it **does**, `Q` is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{ x = 0 } x := x + 1 { x = 1 }` ✅ valid\n",
    "- `{ x = 0 ∧ y = 1 } x := x + 1 { x = 1 ∧ y = 2 }` ❌ invalid\n",
    "- `{ x = 0 ∧ y = 1 } x := x + 1 { x = 1 ∨ y = 2 }` ✅ valid\n",
    "- `{ x = 0 } while true do skip { x = 1 }` ✅ valid (vacuously, since the loop never terminates)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total vs. Partial Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Partial correctness** (curly braces `{}`):\n",
    "  - Only guarantees correctness **if** the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total correctness** (square brackets `[]`):\n",
    "  - Guarantees both **termination** and **correct output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{ x = 0 } while true do skip { x = 1 }` ✅ partial\n",
    "- `[ x = 0 ] while true do skip [ x = 1 ]` ❌ total\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proofs in Hoare Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to **prove** that Hoare triples are valid using a proof system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `⊨ {P} S {Q}` to denote validity (semantic truth).\n",
    "- Use `⊢ {P} S {Q}` to denote provability (proof exists in system).\n",
    "\n",
    "A good system satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Soundness**: If `⊢ {P} S {Q}`, then `⊨ {P} S {Q}`\n",
    "- **Completeness**: If `⊨ {P} S {Q}`, then `⊢ {P} S {Q}`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Hoare logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The proof system is **sound**.\n",
    "- It is **relatively complete**:\n",
    "  - If you assume a **perfect theorem prover**, the system can prove all valid triples.\n"
