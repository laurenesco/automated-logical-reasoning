    "## Goal of Purification\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a formula $F$ in the **combination theory** $T_1 \\cup T_2$, the goal is to produce:\n",
    "- Two **pure formulas**:\n",
    "  - $F_1$ in $T_1$\n",
    "  - $F_2$ in $T_2$\n",
    "- Such that $F_1 \\land F_2$ is **equisatisfiable** with $F$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: We allow the introduction of **new variables**, so the resulting formulas may not be equivalent to $F$, but **equisatisfiability** is sufficient for deciding satisfiability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Purification Works\n",
    "\n",
    "We **recursively rewrite** impure terms using **fresh variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules:\n",
    "1. If a function $f$ from $T_1$ is applied to a term $t$ not from $T_1`:\n",
    "   - Introduce a fresh variable $z$\n",
    "   - Replace $t$ with $z$ in $f(t)$\n",
    "   - Conjoin $z = t$\n",
    "2. If a predicate $p$ from $T_1$ is applied to a term $t$ not from $T_1$:\n",
    "   - Same strategy: replace with variable and conjoin equality\n",
    "\n",
    "> Repeat this process until no impure terms remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Given theory: **Equality $\\cup$ Rationals**\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "x ≤ f(x) + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `f(x)` is from the **theory of equality**\n",
    "- `≤` and `+1` are from the **theory of rationals**\n",
    "- This formula is **impure**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce new variable `y = f(x)`\n",
    "2. Substitute in original formula:\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   x ≤ y + 1\n",
    "   ∧ y = f(x)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- First conjunct belongs to rationals\n",
    "- Second conjunct belongs to equality\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complex Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Given theory: **Equality $\\cup$ Integers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Original formula:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "f(x + g(y)) ≤ g(a) + f(b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step Purification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `g(y)` → `z1 = g(y)`\n",
    "2. `x + z1` → `z2 = x + z1`\n",
    "3. `f(z2)` → `z3 = f(z2)`\n",
    "4. `g(a)` → `z4 = g(a)`\n",
    "5. `f(b)` → `z5 = f(b)`\n",
    "6. Final purified formula:\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   z3 ≤ z4 + z5\n",
    "   ∧ z1 = g(y)\n",
    "   ∧ z2 = x + z1\n",
    "   ∧ z3 = f(z2)\n",
    "   ∧ z4 = g(a)\n",
    "   ∧ z5 = f(b)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- First line is a **pure integer** formula\n",
    "- Remaining lines are **pure equality** formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared vs Unshared Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "After purification, some variables may appear in both $F_1$ and $F_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shared Variables**: occur in **both** $F_1$ and $F_2$\n",
    "- **Unshared Variables**: occur in **only one** of the formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters:\n",
    "- Shared variables are the **only** link between the theories\n",
    "- These will be used during **equality propagation** (next step)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Identify Shared Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Purified formulas:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "F₁ (T₁: Integers):     w1 + x = y\n",
    "F₂ (T₂: Equality):      f(w1) = w2 ∧ f(x) = w2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **w1**: shared (appears in both)\n",
    "- **x**: shared\n",
    "- **y**: unshared (only in F₁)\n",
    "- **w2**: shared\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purification** transforms an impure formula into **two pure, equisatisfiable** subformulas\n",
    "- Achieved by:\n",
    "  - Replacing impure subterms with fresh variables\n",
    "  - Conjoining appropriate equalities\n",
    "- Prepares the formula for **equality propagation** across shared variables in the next phase of the Nelson-Oppen method\n"
