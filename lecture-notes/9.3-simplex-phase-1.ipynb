    "The **simplex algorithm** has two main phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phase 1 – Feasibility**\n",
    "   - Checks whether the linear program (LP) is feasible\n",
    "   - If feasible, produces a **slack form** where the **basic solution is feasible**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Phase 2 – Optimization**\n",
    "   - Starts from a feasible slack form\n",
    "   - Iteratively rewrites slack forms to **maximize the objective**\n",
    "\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "- A basic variable (e.g., slack variable $x_4$) is assigned a **negative** value — violating non-negativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases:\n",

    "## Core Idea of Phase 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We construct an **auxiliary linear program (auxiliary LP)**:\n",

    "- This auxiliary LP is related to the original LP\n",
    "- It is constructed such that:\n",
    "  - It is **guaranteed to have a feasible basic solution** after at most **one pivot**\n",
    "  - It helps us determine if the **original LP is feasible**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **original LP is feasible** if and only if the **auxiliary LP has optimal objective value = 0**\n",

    "## Constructing the Auxiliary LP\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an original LP in standard form:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduce a new variable**: $x_0$\n",
    "2. **Modify each constraint**:\n",
    "   - Subtract $x_0$ from the **LHS** of each inequality\n",
    "3. **New objective function**:  \n",
    "   Replace the original objective with **maximize $-x_0$**\n",

    "- Let $x_0 = 0$, keep $x^*$\n",
    "- This is a feasible solution to the auxiliary LP with objective value 0\n",
