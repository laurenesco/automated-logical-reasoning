    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous video, we saw how satisfiability in the **quantifier-free theory of the rationals** (QF-LRA) can be encoded as a **linear programming (LP)** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we turn to the problem of actually **solving** such linear programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Algorithms for Solving LP\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several well-known algorithms for solving linear programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplex Algorithm** (1949)\n",
    "- **Ellipsoid Method** (1979)\n",
    "- **Interior Point Method** (1984)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Focus on Simplex?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conceptually simpler** than the others\n",
    "- Despite its **worst-case exponential runtime**, it performs very well **in practice**\n",
    "- Many LP solvers today still rely heavily on it\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity of LP Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ellipsoid and interior point methods** are guaranteed to solve any LP in **polynomial time**\n",
    "- **Simplex** can perform poorly on **pathological cases**, with **exponential time**\n",
    "- However, such cases are **extremely rare**\n",
    "  - In practice, **simplex is very efficient**\n",

    "## Preprocessing for Simplex: Normal Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Simplex algorithm** assumes that the LP is in a particular structured form, called **slack form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we get there, we must first convert the LP into **standard form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Form\n",
    "\n",
    "A **linear program in standard form** requires that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All variables satisfy **non-negativity constraints**:  \n",
    "   $x_i \\geq 0$ for all $i$\n",
    "2. All constraints are of the form:  \n",
    "   $Ax \\leq b$\n",
    "3. Objective is to **maximize**:  \n",
    "   $c^\\top x$\n",
    "\n",
    "### What if the Original LP Has Negative Variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this seems limiting, because many LPs involve **variables that can take on negative values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any LP can be **transformed** into an **equisatisfiable standard form** that preserves both **feasibility** and **optimality**.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformation Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "If a variable $x$ is unconstrained in sign (i.e., can be negative), we rewrite it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x = x' - x''\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: $-2 = 4 - 6$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x', x'' \\geq 0$\n",
    "- $x'$ captures the **positive** part, and $x''$ captures the **negative** part\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a standard trick in LPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the original LP involves a variable $x_2$ without a non-negativity constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replace $x_2$ with $x_2' - x_2''$\n",
    "- Enforce: $x_2', x_2'' \\geq 0$ (corresponding non-negativity constraints)\n",
    "- Replace **every occurrence** of $x_2$ with $x_2' - x_2''$\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing this for all such variables, the LP is now in **standard form**.\n",

    "The **simplex algorithm** operates not directly on standard form, but on **slack form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting Standard Form to Slack Form\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Slack form replaces inequalities with equalities** by introducing **slack variables**.\n",
    "2. All variables (including slacks) are subject to **non-negativity constraints**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "For each inequality of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_i^\\top x \\leq b_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce a **slack variable** $s_i \\geq 0$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_i^\\top x + s_i = b_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable $s_i$ captures the **\"leftover room\"**, the **\"slack\"**, in the inequality â€” the amount by which the constraint is not tight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Original constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_1 + x_2 - x_3 \\leq 7$\n",
    "- $-x_1 - x_2 + x_3 \\leq -7$\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce slack variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_4 = 7 - x_1 - x_2 + x_3$\n",
    "- $x_5 = -7 + x_1 + x_2 - x_3$\n",
    "- $x_6 = \\dots$ (for third constraint)\n",
    "\n",
    "Add constraints: $x_4, x_5, x_6 \\geq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the LP is in **slack form**: all constraints are **equalities**, and all variables are **non-negative**.\n",
