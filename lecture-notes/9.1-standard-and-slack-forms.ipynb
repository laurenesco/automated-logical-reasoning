    "# Lecture Notes: Solving Linear Programming Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we saw how checking satisfiability over the rationals can be formulated as a **linear programming (LP)** problem. Now, we explore how to **solve** such LP problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several popular algorithms for solving LPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplex Algorithm** (1949)\n",
    "- **Ellipsoid Method** (1979)\n",
    "- **Interior Point Method** (1984)\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its **worst-case exponential complexity**, the **simplex algorithm** is:\n",
    "- Conceptually simple\n",
    "- Effective in practice for most LP problems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity of Linear Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ellipsoid** and **Interior Point** methods run in **polynomial time**\n",
    "- **Simplex** may take **exponential time** in worst cases, but these are **rare/pathological**\n",
    "- Thus, simplex is widely used in practice\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing for Simplex: Normal Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplex algorithm requires LPs to be in **slack form**, but to get there, we first convert to **standard form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Form\n",
    "\n",
    "An LP is in standard form if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All variables $x_i \\geq 0$\n",
    "- Constraints are of the form $Ax \\leq b$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Standard Form?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, the $x_i \\geq 0$ constraint may seem restrictive (some LPs allow negative variables), but:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any LP can be converted into an **equivalent** standard form that preserves satisfiability and optimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conversion Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "Any variable $x$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "- $x = x' - x''$\n",
    "- Where $x', x'' \\geq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if $x_2$ has no non-negativity constraint, define:\n",
    "- $x_2 = x_2' - x_2''$, with $x_2', x_2'' \\geq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then **replace every occurrence** of $x_2$ with $x_2' - x_2''$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slack Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in standard form, convert to **slack form**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inequalities become **equalities** by adding **slack variables**\n",
    "- Constraints become:  \n",
    "  $a_i^\\top x + s_i = b_i$\n",
    "- Slack variables $s_i \\geq 0$ represent the \"slack\" in the original inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conversion Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Given three inequalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce slack variables $x_4$, $x_5$, $x_6$  \n",
    "- Each inequality becomes an equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $x_4 = 7 - x_1 - x_2 + x_3$\n",
    "  - $x_5 = -7 + x_1 + x_2 - x_3$\n",
    "  - ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- All slack variables must satisfy $x_i \\geq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic and Non-Basic Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in slack form, we distinguish between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic variables**: appear on **left-hand side** of equations\n",
    "- **Non-basic variables**: appear on **right-hand side**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially:\n",
    "- Basic variables = slack variables\n",
    "- Non-basic variables = original decision variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Over time**, the simplex algorithm **swaps** which variables are basic/non-basic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a slack form LP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set all non-basic variables to 0**\n",
    "2. Solve for basic variables using the equality constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "If $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$ are non-basic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set them to 0\n",
    "- Compute basic variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $x_4 = 30$\n",
    "  - $x_5 = 24$\n",
    "  - $x_6 = 36$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **basic solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "A **basic solution is feasible** if **all variables** (basic + non-basic) satisfy the **non-negativity** constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If any variable is negative $\\Rightarrow$ not feasible\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplex Algorithm: Two Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Determine Feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine if the LP is feasible\n",
    "- If **not feasible**, report infeasibility\n",
    "- If **feasible**, find a **slack form** where the **basic solution is feasible**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with feasible basic solution\n",
    "- **Iteratively improve** the objective value\n",
    "- Continue until:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Optimal value found\n",
    "  - Or determine the LP is **unbounded**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Phase 1 internally uses Phase 2, so we study Phase 2 first.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore **Phase 2** of simplex (the optimization phase)\n",
    "- Then revisit **Phase 1** and how to check feasibility\n",
