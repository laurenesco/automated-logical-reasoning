    "\n",
    "Up to now, we've studied decision procedures for **conjunctive formulas** in various first-order theories. To handle disjunctions, we often mentioned converting to **disjunctive normal form (DNF)**. However:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Converting to DNF causes exponential blowup**.\n",
    "- Unlike CNF, DNF lacks efficient satisfiability-preserving transformations.\n",
    "- We need a better approach for formulas involving rich Boolean structure **and** first-order theories.\n",

    "2. Query the SAT solver on the boolean abstraction, if UNSAT, then also UNSAT modulo theory.\n",
    "3. If SAT, ask the **theory solver**: is this assignment consistent with the theory?\n",
    "   - If **yes** → satisfiable.\n",
    "   - If **no** → generate a **theory conflict clause** to block that assignment and repeat.\n",

    "2. Ask theory solver: is this theory-consistent?\n",
