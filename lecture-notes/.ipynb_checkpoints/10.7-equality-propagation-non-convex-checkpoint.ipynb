    "# Lecture Notes: Nelson-Oppen for Non-Convex Theories\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lecture, we saw that the **Nelson-Oppen method works well for convex theories** by propagating **implied equalities** between shared variables. But this approach **fails** when combining **non-convex** theories.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Convexity Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reminder: Convex Theory\n",
    "A theory $T$ is **convex** if:\n",
    "> If $f \\models (x = y_1) \\lor (x = y_2) \\lor \\dots \\lor (x = y_n)$,  \n",
    "> then $f$ must imply **one of the equalities** individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Method Fails on Non-Convex Theories\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "1 ≤ x ≤ 2 ∧ f(x) ≠ f(1) ∧ f(x) ≠ f(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- $x$ must be 1 or 2 (integers only), so the formula is **unsatisfiable**.\n",
    "- But:\n",
    "  - The purified subformulas do **not** individually imply equalities.\n",
    "  - Equality propagation for convex theories would incorrectly conclude **satisfiability**.\n",

    "## Modified Method for Non-Convex Theories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea:\n",
    "Propagate **disjunctions** of equalities between shared variables (not just individual equalities).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure:\n",
    "1. **Purify** the formula into $F_1$ and $F_2$ for theories $T_1$ and $T_2$.\n",
    "2. Identify **disjunctions** of equalities that are implied by one of the subformulas (e.g., $x = y_1 \\lor x = y_2 \\lor \\dots$).\n",
    "3. Create a **branch for each disjunct**:\n",
    "   - Conjoin one equality (e.g., $x = y_i$) to the **other** formula.\n",
    "   - Solve each resulting subproblem.\n",
    "4. If **all** subproblems are unsatisfiable → formula is **unsatisfiable**.\n",
    "   - If **any** is satisfiable → formula is **satisfiable**.\n",

    "- If both $T_1$ and $T_2$ are decidable in **polynomial time** and **convex**, Nelson-Oppen yields a **polynomial-time** decision procedure.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Nelson-Oppen method** provides a modular way to combine decision procedures — but whether you use the **equality-only propagation** (convex) or the **branching over disjunctions** (non-convex) approach depends crucially on the **convexity** of the theories involved.\n",
