    "The second phase of the **Nelson-Oppen method** is called **equality propagation**, where:\n",
    "- Equalities implied by one theory are propagated to the other\n",
    "- This phase behaves **differently** depending on whether the theories are **convex** or **non-convex**\n",

    "A theory $T$ is **convex** if:\n",

    "   - Use each theory’s decision procedure to check satisfiability of $F_1$ and $F_2$\n",

    "  - $x ≥ y$\n",
    "  - $x ≤ y$\n",

    "  - Also implies $z = 0$\n",
    "- Propagate:\n",
    "  - Conjoin $x = y$ to $F_1$\n",
