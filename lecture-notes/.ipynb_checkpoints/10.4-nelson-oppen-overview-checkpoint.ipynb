    "# Lecture Notes: The Nelson-Oppen Method for Combining Decision Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've studied **decision procedures** for individual theories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Theory of Equality\n",
    "- Theory of Rationals\n",
    "- Theory of Integers\n",
    "- Theory of Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in real-world applications, we often encounter **formulas involving multiple theories**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula:\n",
    "```\n",
    "f(x) = f(y) ∧ x ≤ 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `f(x)` involves **uninterpreted functions** (theory of equality)\n",
    "- `x ≤ 3` involves **integer arithmetic**\n",
    "\n",
    "So this formula belongs to the **combination** of:\n",
    "- Theory of Equality\n",
    "- Theory of Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Combination Theory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two theories $T_1$ and $T_2$ that **share the equality symbol**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **combination theory** $T_1 \\cup T_2$:\n",
    "  - Includes **all symbols** from $T_1$ and $T_2$\n",
    "  - Includes **all axioms** from both $T_1$ and $T_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: $T_{\\text{Equality}} \\cup T_{\\text{Integers}}$ combines congruence + integer arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Nelson-Oppen Method: Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Nelson-Oppen algorithm** provides a way to:\n",
    "- Combine decision procedures $P_1$ and $P_2$ for $T_1$ and $T_2$\n",
    "- Obtain a decision procedure for the **combination theory** $T_1 \\cup T_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use it to combine **multiple theories**:\n",
    "- First combine $T_1$ and $T_2$ into $T_{12}$\n",
    "- Then combine $T_{12}$ with $T_3$, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Restrictions of the Nelson-Oppen Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The method **only works** under specific conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Quantifier-Free** Fragments Only\n",
    "- Each theory must have a decision procedure for its **quantifier-free fragment**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Conjunctions Only** (No Disjunctions)\n",
    "- The input formulas must be conjunctions of literals\n",
    "- You can convert formulas to **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)** and check each conjunction separately\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Only Equality is Shared**\n",
    "- The **only shared symbol** between theories must be **equality (`=`)**\n",
    "- No shared arithmetic operators like `+`, `≤`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Stable Infiniteness**\n",
    "- A theory is **stably infinite** if every satisfiable formula has a model with **infinite cardinality**\n",
    "- This allows models of each theory to be merged\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Theories like:\n",
    "- Equality\n",
    "- Rationals\n",
    "- Integers\n",
    "- Arrays  \n",
    "are **stably infinite**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Example that violates condition 3:\n",
    "- Theory of Integers and Theory of Rationals → both share `+`, `≤`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Overview of the Nelson-Oppen Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm consists of **two main phases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Purification**\n",
    "- Given a formula $F$ in $T_1 \\cup T_2$, separate it into:\n",
    "  - $F_1$ (purely in $T_1$)\n",
    "  - $F_2$ (purely in $T_2$)\n",
    "- The split must preserve **equisatisfiability**:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  F_1 \\land F_2 \\equiv F\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Purification introduces **fresh variables** to separate theory-specific terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Equality Propagation**\n",
    "- Theories **share only equality**\n",
    "- We propagate **equalities** inferred by $F_1$ and $F_2$\n",
    "- We repeat until:\n",
    "  - Satisfiability is determined\n",
    "  - Or a contradiction is found\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convex vs Non-Convex Theories\n",
    "\n",
    "The **equality propagation** phase depends on:\n",
    "- Whether the theory is **convex** or **non-convex**\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll explore the difference and how it affects the method in upcoming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
