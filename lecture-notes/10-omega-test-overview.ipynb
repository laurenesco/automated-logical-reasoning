    "- In the **theory of rationals**, solutions can be fractional (e.g., $x = 1.5$ is valid)\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Omega test** is an **elimination-based** decision procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitively**, we can think of eliminating a variable as doing a projection from n-dimensional space into a lower n-1 dimensional subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Strategy:\n",
    "- **Eliminate variables one by one**\n",
    "- Reduce from $n$ variables → $n - 1$ variables → ... → 0\n",
    "- At each step, project the constraints into a lower-dimensional space\n",
    "- Final result is either **true** or **false**\n",
    "\n",
    "At every step, we are making the problem easier, because we are reducing the dimensionality of the polytope, so eventually it simplifies to either true or false.\n",

    "- **Over-approximation** of satisfiability over integers\n",
    "- Constructed so that:\n",
    "  - If the real shadow has **no integer solutions**, the **original problem is UNSAT**\n",

    "### 2. **Dark Shadow**\n",
    "- **Under-approximation** of satisfiability\n",
    "- Constructed so that:\n",
    "  - If the dark shadow **has integer solutions**, the **original problem is SAT**\n",
    "- Again, smaller problem with one fewer variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Gray Shadow**\n",
    "- Covers the \"in-between\" region between real and dark shadows\n",
    "- Needed if:\n",
    "  - Real shadow is SAT but dark shadow is UNSAT\n",
    "- There may be **multiple gray shadows**\n",
