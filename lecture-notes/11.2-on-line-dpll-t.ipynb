    "# SMT Solvers and the DPLL(T) Framework – Lecture Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture explains how SMT solvers work by integrating theory solvers directly into the **CDCL** (Conflict-Driven Clause Learning) loop used in SAT solvers. This integration improves performance over treating the SAT solver as a black box.\n",

    "- In earlier videos, we used the SAT solver as a black box.\n",
    "- In practice, this is inefficient for large formulas with many propositional variables.\n",

    "### Example Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose:\n",
    "- $x = y$ is abstracted as $b_1$\n",
    "- $x < y$ is abstracted as $b_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "During the CDCL loop, if:\n",
    "- $b_1 = \\text{true}$ and $b_2 = \\text{true}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment might be inconsistent modulo the theory, but the SAT solver (as a black box) won’t catch it early.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Desired Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to **detect theory-level contradictions early**, as soon as a partial assignment becomes inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates **integrating** the theory solver into the CDCL loop.\n",

    "1. **Decide**: Choose a propositional variable and assign it true/false.\n",
    "2. **Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP)**: Apply unit propagation to find implications of assignments.\n",
    "3. **Analyze Conflict**: If a conflict is found, use an implication graph to:\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "- SMT formula contains $x = y$, $y = z$, $x < z$\n",
    "- Abstracted as $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$\n",
    "- $b_1 = \\text{true}$, $b_2 = \\text{true}$\n",

    "- The theory solver can detect that $b_1 \\land b_2 \\Rightarrow \\lnot b_3$\n",
    "- This is a **theory propagation lemma**.\n",
    "- It can be added to the Boolean abstraction safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "These lemmas:\n",
    "- Are **always valid modulo the theory**\n",
    "- Help prevent bad search paths\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Are Theory Propagation Lemmas Obtained?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Black-box query**: Ask theory solver whether a literal is implied by current assignment.\n",
    "   - Simple but inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modified theory solver**: Implement implication detection directly.\n",
    "   - More efficient.\n",
    "   - Used by most competitive SMT solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which Lemmas to Add?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many possible lemmas could be implied. Two strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exhaustive Theory Propagation**\n",
    "   - Add all implied literals\n",
    "   - Costly\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Heuristic/Selective Propagation**\n",
    "   - Add only “obviously” implied literals\n",
    "   - Based on heuristics\n",
    "   - Most solvers use this approach\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- SMT solvers use the **DPLL(T)** architecture.\n",
    "- The theory solver is integrated into the SAT solving loop.\n",
    "- Theory conflicts and theory propagation lemmas help prune the search space.\n",
    "- Efficient solvers:\n",
    "  - Modify the theory solver for fast implication detection\n",
